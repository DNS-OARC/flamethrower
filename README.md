Overview
--------

Flamethrower is a small, fast, configurable tool for functional testing, benchmarking, and stress testing DNS servers and networks. It supports IPv4, IPv6, UDP, TCP, TCPTLS, QUIC and has a modular system for generating queries used in the tests.

Dependencies
------------

* CMake >= 3.8
* Linux or OSX
* libuv >= 1.23.0
* libldns >= 1.7.0
* gnutls >= 3.3
* C++ compiler supporting C++17

Build
-----

CMake based build, requires dependencies above. You may need to set PKG_CONFIG_PATH to help locate the dependencies.
```
mkdir build; cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Experimental support is included for DNS-over-QUIC, following the draft RFC https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-huitema-quic-dnsoquic/
DoQ requires additional dependencies:
 * quicly https://github.com/h2o/quicly
 * openssl >= 1.0.2
 
To build with DoQ support, first checkout and build quicly:
```
git clone https://github.com/h2o/quicly.git
cd quicly
git submodule update --init --recursive
mkdir build; cd build
cmake ..
make
```
the name of the "build" directory used to build quicly is significant, as it's referenced in the flamethrower paths.
You then need to manually symlink quicly into the flamethrower 3rd party directory before enabling support in flamethrower and building:
```
cd flamethrower
ln -s <PATH-TO-QUICLY> 3rd/
mkdir build; cd build
cmake -DQUIC_ENABLE=ON ..
make
```

Usage
-----

Current command line options are described with:

```
flame --help
```

Quick Examples
--------

Flame localhost port 53, UDP, maximum speed:
```
flame localhost
```

Flame target, port 5300, TCP:
```
flame -p 5300 -P tcp target.test.com
```

Flame target, port 443, TCPTLS:
```
flame -p 443 -P tcptls target.test.com
```

Flame target with random labels:
```
flame target.test.com -g randomlabel lblsize=10 lblcount=4 count=1000
```

Flame multiple target at once, reading the list from a file:
```
flame file --targets myresolvers.txt
```

Detailed Features
-----------------

### Query Generators

 Flamethrower uses a modular system for generating queries. Most modules generate all queries before sending begins, for performance reasons.
 Each module may include its own list of configuration options which can be set via key/value pairs on the command line.
 See full `--help` for the current list of generators and their options.

### Rate Limiting

 By default, Flamethrower will send traffic as fast as possible. To limit to a specific overall queries per second, use `-Q`

### Dynamic QPS Flow

 Flamethrower can adjust its QPS flow over time. This is useful for generating a "signal" of traffic (e.g. a square wave) for calibrating metrics collection. For example, to send 10 QPS for 120000ms, then 80 QPS for 120000ms, etc use `--qps-flow "10,120000;80,120000;10,120000;"`. Flow change will not loop, you should list as many changes as necessary. Once the flow reaches the final QPS number, it will hold it until program termination.

### Output Metrics

 Flamethrower can generate detailed metrics for each of its concurrent senders. Metrics include send and receive counts, timeouts, min, max and average latency, errors, and the like. The output format is JSON, and is suitable for ingestion into databases such as Elastic for further processing or visualization. See the `-o` flag.

### Concurrency

 Flamethrower is single threaded, async i/o. You specify the amount of concurrent senders with the `-c` option. Each of these senders will send a configurable number of consecutive queries (see `-q`), then enter a configurable delay period (see `-d`) before looping.

 Each concurrent sender will pull the next query from the total queries generated by the Query Generator, looping once it reaches the end of the query list (if the program is configured to continue).

 There is currently no built-in support for multiprocess sending, so the maximum throughput will be reached once a single CPU is saturated. However, you may manually start several concurrent `flame` processes, including up to 1 per CPU available. There is future planned support for builtin multiprocess sending.
